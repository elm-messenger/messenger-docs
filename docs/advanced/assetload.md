# Initial Asset Loading Scene

:::warning
Work in Progress. The example is deprecated.
Use the [asset loading GC](../advanced/gc.md) instead.
:::

Users may want to have an asset loading scene just like what Reweave does.

When Messenger is loading assets, `update` of the initial scene will not be called. All the user input and events are ignored. However, `view` will be called. `globalTime` and `currentTimeStamp` will be updated but `sceneStartTime` will not be updated.

Moreover, users can get the number of loaded assets by using the `loadedResourceNum` function. Then you can compare it with `resourceNum resource`.

An example:

```elm
startText : GlobalData UserData -> Renderable
startText gd =
    let
        loaded =
            loadedResourceNum gd

        total =
            resourceNum resources

        progress =
            String.slice 0 4 <| String.fromFloat (toFloat loaded / toFloat total * 100)

        text =
            if loaded /= total then
                "Loading... " ++ progress ++ "%"

            else
                "Click to start"
    in
    group [ alpha (0.7 + sin (toFloat gd.globalTime / 10) / 3) ]
        [ renderTextWithColorCenter gd 60 text "Arial" Color.black ( 960, 900 )
        ]
```

The full example is in [messenger examples](https://github.com/linsyking/messenger-examples/tree/main/spritesheet).
